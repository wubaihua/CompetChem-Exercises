Computation Chemistry Programming Exercises

Author: Baihua Wu(wubaihua@pku.edu.cn) 

This project is a programming exercises project from Crawdad's website(http://sirius.chem.vt.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=crawdad:programming).The origin version on website is written by C++. I wrote fortran and C++ versions respectively.  

This exercises is still unfinished. Some results is still wrong. It must have a lot of bugs in the code. I will try to finish it in the future.

## TODO
1. Finishing this project.
2. Writing a python version.
